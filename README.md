# What is the Developer Portal Documentation Service?

With this portal, developers like you can write project documentation with markdown files, in your own git repositories. They are then automatically synced and published to the documentation portal.

## Why do I have to write technical documentation?

Technical documentation is crucial for your users to understand and use your software and its APIs. It helps you support customers better while significantly [improving the satisfaction of your users with your product.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037872069090063N)

## Public and private documentation

You have the choice in deciding who can access your documentation: the public, logged in users<sup>*</sup>, or users with specific emails or email domains.

<sup>*</sup> only TechPass users

## Write in markdown or OpenAPI/Swagger

The developer documentation portal supports two documentation formats:

- Markdown, rendered with the [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org) documentation renderer.
- OpenAPI (also known as Swagger) definitions in JSON or YAML, rendered through the [ReDoc](https://github.com/redocly/redoc) API documentation renderer.
